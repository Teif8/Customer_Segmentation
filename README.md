# Customer_Segmentation_using_Clustering_Algorithms

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques. By leveraging clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN, KMeans, and Agglomerative Clustering, we group customers based on their behavioral patterns and features.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning algorithms)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)
- **Seaborn** (for advanced data visualization)

## Files in the Repository
- `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that contains all code related to data processing, model training, and visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to run the notebook.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Customer_Segmentation.ipynb
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for customer segmentation consists of features describing customer behavior and demographics. This could include purchase history, geographical data, and other relevant features.

## Results
The notebook includes visualizations that display the clusters of customers, enabling businesses to identify distinct segments for targeted marketing strategies.
